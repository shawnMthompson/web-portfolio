# web-portfolio
This is a web portfolio that I designed and developed, showcasing my skills, projects, and contact information. This portfolio was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

#README
This repository contains the source code for my web portfolio.

Features:
* Navigation bar for easy navigation between sections.
* Created a dynamic typing animation effect via JavaScript to simulate the typing of text
* Implemented tabbed content sections dynamically using JavaScript to organize information, allowing the user to switch between tabs interactively without page reloads.
* Incorporated interactive elements within project cards, such as hover effects or clickable links, to dynamically reveal project details or navigate to project demos/repositories.
* Integrated social media icons with interactive hover effects dynamically, such as color changes and animations, to encourage user interaction. (sourced from [fontawesome.com](url))
* Designed the portfolio with a responsive layout that adapts dynamically to various screen sizes and orientations.

Technologies Used:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

Usage:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Open the 'index.html' file in a HTML5-supported web browser to view the portfolio. May require a live server extension or any other self-hosting solution.
